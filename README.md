# Visual Search Experiment Replication

In a visual search experiment, a target is the item that you need to find. A distracter or distractor is an item that you are not looking for, and which distracts you from finding the target.

For human beings, it's easy to search for a target along one dimension such as color or shape (e.g., search for a red 'x' among green 'x's or search for a red 'x' among red 'o's), but it takes more time to search for a target along more than one dimensions such as color and shape combines (e.g., search for a red 'x' among red 'o's and green 'x's).

This project replicate the design of a visual search experiment, from the generation of stimuli to the recording of responses.
